                            As seen in the circuit block diagram above, the outputs C_1, S_1, and S_0 form the sum, in that order. C_1 is the leftmost (most significant) bit and S_0 is the rightmost (least significant) bit. I knew that I would need some combination of half and full adders to create this circuit capable of 2-bit addition, and thinking about the inputs and outputs that would be needed was most helpful. I knew that three output bits would be necessary since our largest possible calculation with two bits (11+11=110) results in three digits. From there, I thought about the process of adding each bit, and how the carrying process would affect the final output. I knew I would need a half adder to calculate the sum of the first bits, and I knew that I would need a full adder to calculate the sum of the second bits since we also needed to account for carrying. From there, I was able to deduce that the Carry Out bit (C_0 in this diagram) from the half adder would have to become the Carry In bit for the full adder. Let's trace some examples to illustrate this!

                            As seen in the circuit block diagram above, the outputs Bout, D_1, and D_0 form the difference, in that order. Bout is the leftmost (most significant) bit and D_0 is the rightmost (least significant) bit. Once again, I knew that I would need some combination of half and full subtractors to create this circuit capable of 2-bit subtraction, due to the fact that three output bits would once again be needed. From there, I thought about the process of subtracting each bit and went through several examples on my own, and I also considered how the borrowing process would affect the final output. Borrowing was harder for me to wrap my head around but constructing a truth table helped me see the pattern. Again, I knew I would need a half subtractor to calculate the difference of the first bits, and I knew that I would need a full subtractor to calculate the difference of the second bits, taking into account the borrow bit. From there, I was able to deduce that the Borrow Out bit (Bout in this diagram) from the half subtractor would have to become the Borrow In bit for the full subtractor.

                        <h3>Deconstruction:</h3>
                        <p>
                            This week's discussions brought up a lot of interesting questions and challenged much of my previous thinking regarding computers and computation. I had my own concept for what I thought a computer was; namely, a device like my laptop or phone that uses electricity and can access the Internet. I had not thought much more deeply about this, but some of the pre-class readings made me recontextualize and reframe what I could accept (or not accept) as a computer. It was really fascinating to me to read about the crabs specifically, as they are animals performing a naturally occurring behavior, just with some human interference that allows their behavior to mimic the logic gates that make up the foundation for what most humans know and accept as computers (Gunji et al., 2011). The slime mold reading challenged me similarly; I had never considered that something biological could potentially be a computer (Lu & Lopes, 2022). Overall, class readings and discussions greatly broadened my idea of what a computer is. <br>
                            The most significant change in my thinking came from my classmate Harry's reflection on our discussions. He brought up that he considers a computer to be something that is currently computing in that moment. Thus, a broken computer isn't a computer, but something like a human brain could be a computer. I think I align most with this definition, although these lines that I've drawn can be blurred when you really take the time to break it down metaphysically. What part of a human brain is performing the computation? Is it just the neurons firing, or is it the rest of the brain matter as well? What about at the atomic level? Without a clear definition of computation, it's really difficult to define what a computer is! This is something that a lot of my classmates touched on, and I remember talking specifically about this issue with Hudson, Joe, and Klaus. This definition also suggests that a lot of things (or everything?) have the potential to become computers. <br>
                            Considering whether or not computers would be computers if humans didn't exist was also really intellectually stimulating. I personally believe that computation would still happen in the form of other biological processes (e.g. photosynthesis), so in that way, computers would still exist. However, everything we know and observe is through a human framework. So, if humans didn't exist and there was no way of bearing witness to computation, computers would also, in a way, not exist. This discussion was particularly mind-bending for me. <br>
                            Somewhat frustratingly, even through all of our rich discussion, I'm still really not 100% sure where I land on some of the questions we've gone through in class. I definitely think that I have devoted more time to considering the metaphysics of computers and I now have a more logic-based understanding of my definition, but so much of what we've discussed is really up for personal interpretation and can be thought of in so many different ways that it's hard (if not impossible) to come to one absolute conclusion. We've gone over some definitions in class, but I think even the definitions of knowledge and truth in themselves can be up for debate. So, just like Carrie Bradshaw, I couldn't help but wonder: is it possible to ever reach consensus on a metaphysical topic like this? What, if anything, can we ever know completely?
